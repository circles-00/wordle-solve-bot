# Skype Status Bot

Just a Puppeteer script that will login to your Skype account and will set your currently playing song on Spotify as status.

# Running

Before trying to run the bot, please refer to the .env.example file

```shell
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

# TODO

- [ ] Refactor code, I'm currently short on time and lazy, I will probably refactor this code when I have some more free time
